## Super Lightweight eCommerce Platform -- Built with AngularJS and Google Sheets

We like to work on a side-projects (maybe even to a fault). We recently released a new SaaS-based e-commerce platform geared for small businesses.  This platform is unique in several ways. First, the database is not really a database at all. The eCommerce platform's data is stored in Google Sheets. The product catalog, category management, and multi-lingual support are maintained using Google Sheets, and every data modification is updated in real-time. We initially started this project as a “proof of concept”, but we were pleasantly surprised how quickly we could launch a new e-commerce storefront. 

The following are other notable features:

1. Google Sheets administrative panel coupled with super fast data caching to improve performance. All updates are performed in real-time, and secure. No need to install any software.
2. Supports PayPal Express. Other payment options to follow soon. 
3.	Built with AngularJS by Google on the front-end. 
4.	Mobile responsive. Looks great on both desktops and mobile devices. Give it a try: [http://store.vineos.io](http://store.vineos.io)
5.	Very theme-able: The sample site theme can be easily modified.
6.	It's FREE.
7.	Mult-lingual support; add as many languages as you want.
